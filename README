This is a project I did for a computational linguistics course. A summary, taken from main.swipl:

"The purpose of this program is to model a subset of
  English allomorphy rules, and to do so principled manner.
  It simulates assimilation in several different
  contexts, such as pluralization and verb conjugation."

Some files were supplied by the professor: entailment.swipl, fulldisplay.swipl, fullproperties.swipl, phone.swipl, and properties.swipl. All others were written by me.
